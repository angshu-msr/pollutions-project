<left><h2><u><b>Defination: </b></u></h2></left>
<p><h2> Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause harm. Pollution can take the form of any substance (solid, liquid, or gas) or energy (such as radioactivity, heat, sound, or light). Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants. Although environmental pollution can be caused by natural events, the word pollution generally implies that the contaminants have a human source, such as manufacturing, extractive industries, poor waste management, transportation or agriculture. Pollution is often classed as point source (coming from a highly concentrated specific site, such as a factory, mine, construction site), or nonpoint source pollution (coming from widespread distributed sources, such as microplastics or agricultural runoff).</p></h2><br><br>

<left><h2><u><b>Types: </b></u></h2></left>
<p><h2> There are many types of pollution in this world. Some types are given below with defination and a photo. <br><br>
1. <u>Air Pollution</u>: Air pollution is the contamination of the atmosphere by harmful substances that affect human health, living organisms, and the environment. It occurs when pollutants such as particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and ozone are released into the air. These pollutants can come from sources like vehicles, industries, household combustion, and forest fires. Air pollution impacts both outdoor and indoor environments, leading to respiratory diseases, environmental damage, and global issues like climate change.<br><br><center><img src="air_pollution.jpg" height="400" width="500"></center><br><br><br>
2. <u>Water Pollution</u>: Water pollution is the contamination of rivers, lakes, oceans, and other water bodies by harmful substances that degrade water quality and make it unsafe for humans, animals, and the environment. It often results from industrial waste, sewage, agricultural runoff, plastics, and chemicals entering water sources. Polluted water can spread diseases, harm aquatic life, and disrupt ecosystems. Since less than 1% of Earth’s freshwater is easily accessible, water pollution poses a serious threat to human survival and biodiversity.<br><br><center><img src="water_pollution.jpg" height="400" width="500"></center><br><br><br>
3. <u>Noise Pollution</u>: Noise pollution is the presence of unwanted or excessive sound in the environment that disrupts normal activities and causes harm to humans, animals, and ecosystems. It is mainly caused by transportation systems, industrial activities, construction work, and urbanization. Prolonged exposure to high noise levels can lead to stress, hearing loss, sleep disturbances, and reduced productivity. Noise pollution also affects wildlife by interfering with communication, navigation, and breeding patterns.<br><br><center><img src="noise_pollution.jpg" height="400" width="500"></center><br><br><br>
4. <u>Soil Pollution</u>: Soil pollution is the degradation of the earth’s surface caused by the presence of harmful chemicals, waste, or pollutants that reduce soil quality and fertility. It occurs when industrial waste, pesticides, plastics, heavy metals, and untreated sewage contaminate the soil. Polluted soil affects plant growth, reduces agricultural productivity, and can transfer toxins into the food chain. Over time, soil pollution also disrupts ecosystems and poses serious risks to human health and biodiversity.<br><br><center><img src="soil_pollution.jpg" height="400" width="500"></center><br><br><br>
5. <u>Visual Pollution</u>: Visual pollution is the presence of unattractive, excessive, or disturbing visual elements in the environment that disrupt the natural or built landscape. It is caused by billboards, litter, construction debris, overhead wires, graffiti, and poorly planned urban structures. Such pollution reduces aesthetic appeal, creates mental stress, and can negatively affect tourism and community well-being. Unlike other forms of pollution, visual pollution impacts psychological health by overwhelming or distracting the human eye.<br><br><center><img src="visual_pollution.jpg" height="400" width="500"></center><br><br><br>
6. <u>Radioactive Pollution</u>: Radioactive pollution is the release of radioactive substances into the environment, causing harmful effects on living organisms and ecosystems. It occurs due to nuclear power plant accidents, improper disposal of radioactive waste, mining of radioactive ores, and nuclear weapon testing. Exposure to radiation can damage cells, lead to genetic mutations, and increase the risk of cancer. Radioactive pollution is particularly dangerous because radioactive materials can remain active and hazardous for thousands of years.<br><br><center><img src="radioactive_pollution.jpg" height="400" width="500"></center><br><br><br><br><br>
